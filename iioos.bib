The bounds for <tex-math>$\Pr \{ S - ES \geq nt \}$</tex-math> depend only on the endpoints of the ranges of the summands and the mean, or the mean and the variance of S. These results are then used to obtain analogous inequalities for certain sums of dependent random variables such as U statistics and the sum of a random sample without replacement from a finite population.},

    abstract = {{Upper Confidence Trees are a very efficient tool for solving Markov Decision Processes; originating in difficult games like the game of Go, it is in particular surprisingly efficient in high dimensional problems. It is known that it can be adapted to continuous domains in some cases (in particular continuous action spaces). We here present an extension of Upper Confidence Trees to continuous stochastic problems. We (i) show a deceptive problem on which the classical Upper Confidence Tree approach does not work, even with arbitrarily large computational power and with progressive widening (ii) propose an improvement, termed double-progressive widening, which takes care of the compromise between variance (we want infinitely many simulations for each action/state) and bias (we want sufficiently many nodes to avoid a bias by the first nodes) and which extends the classical progressive widening (iii) discuss its consistency and show experimentally that it performs well on the deceptive problem and on experimental benchmarks. We guess that the double-progressive widening trick can be used for other algorithms as well, as a general tool for ensuring a good bias/variance compromise in search algorithms.}},

     abstract = {Other than common random numbers, control variates is the most promising variance reduction technique in terms of its potential for widespread use: Control variates is applicable in single or multiple response simulation, it does not require altering the simulation run in any way, and any stochastic simulation contains potential control variates. A rich theory of control variates has been developed in recent years. Most of this theory assumes a specific probabilistic structure for the simulation output process, usually joint normality of the response and the control variates. When these assumptions are not satisfied, desirable properties of the estimator, such as unbiasedness, may be lost. A number of remedies for violations of the assumptions have been proposed, including jackknifing and splitting. However, there has been no systematic analytical and empirical evaluation of these remedies. This paper presents such an evaluation, including evaluation of the small-sample statistical properties of the proposed remedies.},

We have developed a Monte-Carlo Go program, MoGo, which is the first computer Go program using UCT. We explain our modification of UCT for Go application and also the intelligent random simulation with patterns which has improved significantly the performance of MoGo. UCT combined with pruning techniques for large Go board is discussed, as well as parallelization of UCT. MoGo is now a top level Go program on 9x9 and 13x13 Go boards.},
