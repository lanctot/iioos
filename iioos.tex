\begin{abstract}
Online search in games has been a classic interest of artificial intelligence.
Advances made in search for perfect information games (such as Chess, Checkers, Go, and Backgammon) have led to AI capable of defeating the world's top human experts. 
The progress of search in imperfect information games (such as Poker, Bridge, and Skat) has comparatively lagged behind, due mainly to the complexities introduced by hiding information. 
In this paper, we present Online Outcome Sampling (OOS), the first imperfect information search algorithm with formal guarantees of convergence to an equilibrium strategy.   
In addition, we show that OOS avoids the common problems encountered by determinization.
We evaluate the practical performance and convergence rate of OOS and two recent imperfect information search algorithms. OOS performs better than its competitors in randomly generated games as well as three complex domains: Phantom Tic-Tac-Toe, Bluff, and Scotland Yard.  
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Main points: 
\begin{itemize}
\item motivate importance of convergence to NE. 
\item existing methods may not converge over time (it would be great to have a motivating example that convinces the reader that any determinization-based II search algorithm cannot converge in general)
\item we intoduce the first one that does, and show that it can compete with the others in practice
\end{itemize}

\section{Background and Related Work}

Overview of past algorithms and the current state-of-the-art (we have to ``weave'' the related work below into a nice overview).
Define determinization, strategy fusion, non-locality, disambiguation factor.

\subsection{Extensive Games and Equilibrium Computation}

Basic game theoretic definitions. Behavioral strategies. 
CFR~\cite{CFR} and MCCFR~\cite{Lanctot09Sampling}. Success in Poker.

\section{Online Outcome Sampling}

Complexities of online search vs. offline equilibrium computation. Notions of subgame perfection (sequential equilibrium). Information set targeted search. Epistemic depth.
Convergence theorems. Algorithm description.

\section{Empirical Evaluation}

Try it in a few complex domains, but some smaller ones as well to compare to offline-computed approximate equilibrium strategies and compute exploitability, and in random games. 
Hopefully it works well. {\tt :)} I think to convince people doing work in this area, we'll need 
to compare to one or two of the state-of-the-art algorithms. 

\section{Conclusion}

OOS rocks the body that rocks the party! {\tt :-p}
