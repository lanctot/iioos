Online search in games has been a classic interest of artificial intelligence. Advances made in search for perfect information games (such as Chess, Checkers, Go, and Backgammon) have led to AI capable of defeating the world's top human experts. Search in imperfect information games (such as Poker, Bridge, and Skat) is significantly more challenging due to the complexities introduced by hidden information. In this paper, we present Online Outcome Sampling (OOS), the first imperfect information search algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to an equilibrium strategy in a two-player zero-sum game. In addition, we show that OOS avoids common problems encountered by determinization. We evaluate the practical performance and convergence rate of OOS comparing it to benchmark strategies and to Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS). We show that OOS performs at well as ISMCTS in head-to-head play while producing strategies with lower exploitability on two domains: Liar's Dice and a variant of Goofspiel.  Finally, we show that exploitability of strategies produced by OOS decreases as the amount of search time increases.
